Blood Pressure REDCap Data Collection and Charting.

The data dictionary for creating the REDCap project is in `BPColl_DataDictionary.csv`.

Store your api key and api URL for your instance of REDCap into a `project_info.txt`. The python script fetches the data from the survey. The R script generates the chart.

The most recent info is stored in `bpcoll_current.csv` and the most recent plot in `bpcoll_recent.png`
